NAME
----
git-install - installs a git plugin by delegation to a platform package manager


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The intent of this command is to allow a user to install available plugins into the current git installation.

    git install [ plugin-name | plugin-archive | plugin-url | plugin-dir ]

where possible, installation concerns are delegated to the platform's default package manager via 
package-manager adapters (which are themselves plugins). However, support is also offered for 
installing build-less plugins via simpler mechanisms such as:

* unpack-and-go deployments into the plugins/ directory 
* checkout of git repo into the plugins/ directory

Such deployments are only possible for standalone plugin archives or repos that do not require dependency management or
build support. Plugins that do require dependency management and build support should be built using the services
of a package manager or deployed into the plugins/ directory under the control of the plugin's own build script.

Following successful deployment of plugin artifacts into the plugins/ directory, the package is activated
with git-plugin.
