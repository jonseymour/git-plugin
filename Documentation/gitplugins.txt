gitplugins - An overview of the git plugin architecture for extensions.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This document describes the plugin architecture for git extensions.

A git extension is a command, hook, completion or documentation library that
extends the functionality of git while not actually being part of the git-core itself.

git extensions are implemented by git plugins. git provides a place
which package managers and installation scripts can install plugins to.
